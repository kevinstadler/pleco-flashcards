## Useful classroom language vocabulary

[classroom-language.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinstadler/pleco-flashcards/master/flashcards/classroom-language.txt) contains useful classroom language, i.e. basic words that your teachers will use to run as much of your Chinese classes in Chinese as early as possible. The flashcard file contains words organised in two categories: *Classroom words* includes 50 basic verbs and nouns, *Grammar* contains a smaller set of more linguistic terminology.
