## German flashcards for Shadick's *A First Course in Literary Chinese*

The flashcards were not created by myself, I merely extracted the content of an unattributed German language PDF titled *Klassik Shadick-Vokabeln Chinesisch-Deutsch* that's floating around the web.

```
pdftotxt -raw shadick.pdf
pip3 install unidecode
./extract.py
```
